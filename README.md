# PS4-Test
A test PKG made using Unity

This won't work without a jailbroken PS4, loading GoldHEN, and using the
Remote Package Installer or Debug Settings/GoldHEN itself and a USB.

There's nothing interesting in this build, it's just a test built using
this very helpful guide: 
https://github.com/RetroGamer74/HowToBuildWithUnityPS4FakePKG
and some things on Reddit.

This most likely won't work on emulators, but I can't test as I'm using a
Mac with a Windows virtual drive.
